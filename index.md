Hello! This is the Larian Archives, the repository of work written by yours truly, Kylin Vartilo. I've been in the process of developing a contemporary high-fantasy world, but all my longer projects are unfortunately not ready for release. In the meanwhile, I have a lot of short-form content focused on exploring deep feelings of guilt, obligatory sacrifice, desperate ambition, and regret. I'm always excited to talk about my work or collaborate with other fantasy authors, so feel free to DM me on platforms like Bluesky (https://bsky.app/profile/kylinvartilo.bsky.social) or simply reach out to me at kylin.vartilo@gmail.com!

Midley, a college age student, was confident she had her life on the right path. She was popular, kept her grades up, and did community service with her church and on-campus organizations. Her world is shook when her brother, Wesley, commits suicide over summer break. Now, several years in the future, one of Midley's new friends has sensed there is something she isn't telling them. After excessive(?) prodding, Midley finally relents and lets everything out, starting on the day before it happened...

A short story about a mother with intense regrets briefly stepping into an alternative past to right some perceived wrongs at a critical time in her life. There are themes of self hatred and dealing with depressive symptoms which can be uncomfortable to read about. As someone who has been through these struggles, I try to write on these topics to help other people who have experienced these feelings feel seen.

CW list: Violence, Relationship Drama, Self-harm

In the wastes between worlds, the kreket species manages a meager existence marred by constant loss. This story follows Zellek, a high-ranking kreket in the Jaspen Clan, who is struggling with the recent failure of a mission. This is a story which is meant to lend itself to interpretation, but it isn't written to be confusing.

Steep yourself deep in creation, build a legacy, and never stop to look behind at what you may be losing. Long form poetry.
